# sml
To verify that SML Mode is properly installed, let us check that it does indentation/coloring for 
SML files and that you can create the SML read-eval-print-loop (REPL) from within Emacs.

First, edit an existing or new SML file (try C-x C-f test.sml to create a new file if nothing else is handy). 
You should see the mode display at the bottom of the Emacs window change from Fundamental (or whatever it was) 
to SML. If you enter a line of code like val n = 1; you should see colors highlighting the keywords and variable 
names. When you are editing code, whenever you hit the Tab key, Emacs will try to reindent the current line appropriately.

Second, while the cursor is in an SML buffer (i.e., you are editing an SML file), run C-c C-s and press Enter/Return. 
This should split the window and create an SML prompt in a new buffer. In that buffer, you should be able to type 1+1; 
and then Enter/Return at the prompt and see 2 as the result.

# emacs
The most important commands in Emacs:
C-x C-c: Quit Emacs
C-g: Cancel the current action
C-x C-f: Open a file (whether or not it already exists)
C-x C-s: Save a file
C-x C-w: Write a file (probably more familiar to you as Save as...)
Cut, copy, paste:

Highlight text with the mouse or by hitting C-Space to set a mark and then moving the cursor to highlight a region.
C-w: Cut a highlighted region
M-w: Copy a highlighted region
C-k: Cut (kill) from the cursor to the end of the line
C-y: Paste (yank)
Some other useful commands:

C-x 2: Split the window into 2 buffers, one above the other (Use the mouse or C-x o to switch between them)
C-x 0: Undo window-splitting so there is only 1 buffer
C-x b: Switch to another buffer by entering its name
C-x C-b: See a list of all current buffers
Getting help within Emacs: In addition to the help button/menu on the right...

C-h: Hitting this will display a short message in the minibuffer: C-h (Type ? for further options).

C-h b: Key bindings. This lists all key bindings that are valid for the current mode. Note that key 
bindings change from mode to mode.

C-h a: Command apropos. After typing C-h a you can type a symbol and a buffer will appear that 
lists all symbols and functions that match that phrase.
More advanced Emacs hacks (optional):

If you are curious, try some of these once you have finished the rest of the setup instructions.
They are unnecessary for any of the work we will do, but may be convenient.

Change the colors of your syntax highlighting. In version 24 of Emacs, M-x customize-themes is a good place to start.
General customization interface: Open the Options menu and choose the first item under Customize Emacs. 
This will let you customize Emacs through a sort-of-graphical interface. It saves all your settings in a file 
in your "home" directory, ~/.emacs.
Much, much, much more: Emacs calls itself an extensible editor for a reason.
