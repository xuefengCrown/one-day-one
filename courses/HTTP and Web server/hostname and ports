In the terminal, you can use the host program to look up hostnames in DNS:

Some systems don't have the host command, but do have a similar command called nslookup. 
This command also displays the IP address for the hostname you give it; but it also shows the 
IP address of the DNS server that's giving it the answer:

# get IP corresponding hostname
nslookup www.google.com

# 使用http://freegeoip.net/json/的服务，你可以获得该IP的详细信息。
import json
from urllib import urlopen
def getCountry(ipAddress):
    response = urlopen("http://freegeoip.net/json/" +
                       ipAddress).read().decode('utf-8')
    responseJson = json.loads(response)
    print responseJson
    return responseJson.get("country_code")
print(getCountry("121.97.110.145"))

# nslookup www.sina.com
名称:    www.sina.com
Address:  112.13.174.126

# 获得该IP address 的 详细信息
# http://freegeoip.net/json/112.13.174.126
{"ip":"112.13.174.126","country_code":"CN","country_name":"China","region_code":"","region_name":"","city":"",
"zip_code":"","time_zone":"","latitude":34.7725,"longitude":113.7266,"metro_code":0}

We say that a server "listens on" a port, such as 80 or 8000. "Listening" means that when the server starts up, 
it tells its operating system that it wants to receive connections from clients on a particular port number. 
When a client (such as a web browser) "connects to" that port and sends a request, the operating system knows 
to forward that request to the server that's listening on that port.
