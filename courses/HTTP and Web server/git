open your terminal and run these commands:

git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-ud303
cd course-ud303
git remote remove origin

This will put your shell into a directory called course-ud303 containing the downloadable exercises. 
Take a look around at the subdirectories here. For each exercise, you'll be using one of them.
