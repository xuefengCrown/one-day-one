Scheme
The first part of a URI is the scheme, which tells the client how to go about accessing the resource. 
Some URI schemes you've seen before include http, https, and file. File URIs tell the client to access 
a file on the local filesystem. HTTP and HTTPS URIs point to resources served by a web server.

// such as
file:///C:/code_dxf/

Other URI parts
There are many other parts that can occur in a URI. Consider the difference between these two Wikipedia URIs:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen#Discovery

If you follow these links in your browser, it will fetch the same page from Wikipedia's web server. 
But the second one displays the page scrolled to the section about the discovery of oxygen. 
The part of the URI after the # sign is called a fragment. The browser doesn't even send it 
to the web server. It lets a link point to a specific named part of a resource; in HTML 
pages it links to an element by id.
