当然，递归的最大练习来自于scheme和lisp的学习！

重要的递归练习
1. max

2. draw english ruler

3. P-4.25 Provide a nonrecursive implementation of the draw interval function for
the English ruler project of Section 4.1.2. There should be precisely 2 c −1
lines of output if c represents the length of the center tick. If incrementing
a counter from 0 to 2 c −2, the number of dashes for each tick line should
be exactly one more than the number of consecutive 1’s at the end of the
binary representation of the counter.

4. P-4.26 Write a program that can solve instances of the Tower of Hanoi problem
(from Exercise C-4.14).

5. P-4.27 Python’s os module provides a function with signature walk(path) that
is a generator yielding the tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) for each
subdirectory of the directory identified by string path, such that string
dirpath is the full path to the subdirectory, dirnames is a list of the names
of the subdirectories within dirpath, and filenames is a list of the names
of non-directory entries of dirpath. For example, when visiting the cs016
subdirectory of the file system shown in Figure 4.6, the walk would yield
( /user/rt/courses/cs016 , [ homeworks , programs ], [ grades ]) .
Give your own implementation of such a walk function.
