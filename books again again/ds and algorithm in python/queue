FIFO
A queue would therefore be a logical choice for a data structure to handle calls to a
customer service center, or a wait-list at a restaurant. FIFO queues are also used by
many computing devices, such as a networked printer, or a Web server responding
to requests.

## Using an Array Circularly
Implementing this circular view is not difficult. When we dequeue an element
and want to “advance” the front index, we use the arithmetic f = (f + 1) % N.
Internally, the queue class maintains the following three instance variables:
_data: is a reference to a list instance with a fixed capacity.
_size: is an integer representing the current number of elements stored
in the queue (as opposed to the length of the data list).
_front: is an integer that represents the index within data of the first
element of the queue (assuming the queue is not empty).
