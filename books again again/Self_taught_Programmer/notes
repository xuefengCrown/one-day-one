# My goal is to give you a map—an outline of all of the skills you need to develop in
order to program professionally.


Learning a programming language is only part of the battle. There are other skills you
need in order to speak the language of computer scientists. 

The introduction to programming books are all the same. 
They teach you the basics of how to program in either Python or Ruby and
send you on your way. The feedback I’ve heard from people finishing these books is, “What
do I do now? I am not a programmer yet, and I don’t know what to learn next.” This book is
my answer to that question.

How This Book Is Structured
This book is divided into six parts, based on moving through the following stages:
learning to program, 
learning object-oriented programming, 
learning to use programs (like your operating system) that will make you a better programmer, 
learning Computer Science,
learning to program for production 
and getting a job and working on a team.
