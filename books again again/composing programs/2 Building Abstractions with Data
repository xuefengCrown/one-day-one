# 数据抽象
This chapter focuses on data. The techniques we investigate here will allow us to represent and manipulate 
information about many different domains. Due to the explosive growth of the Internet, a vast amount of 
structured information is freely available to all of us online, and computation can be applied to a vast 
range of different problems. Effective use of built-in and user-defined data types are fundamental to 
data processing applications.

# Non-numeric types. Values can represent many other types of data, such as sounds, images, locations, 
web addresses, network connections, and more. A few are represented by native data types, such as the 
bool class for values True and False. The type for most values must be defined by programmers using 
the means of combination and abstraction that we will develop in this chapter.
