The increasing number of people contributing to the Internet, either deliberately or
incidentally, has created a huge set of data that gives us millions of potential insights
into user experience（用户体验）, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general.
This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of collective intelligence. It
covers ways to get hold of interesting datasets from many web sites you’ve probably
heard of, ideas on how to collect data from users of your own applications, and
many different ways to analyze and understand the data once you’ve found it.
This book’s goal is to take you beyond simple database-backed applications and
teach you how to write smarter programs to take advantage of the information you
and others collect every day.
